# ScriptingAutomation
Project for scripting and automation class(AIST2120)
In this project, I created a python script that took input from the user(a password to guess and a minimum password length) and guess a password.
Using all characters and a dictionary of password, Should the dictionary attack fail, it guesses the password with a brute force attack up to 65000 times
It then prompts the user to continue or exit the program.
