# Project 1z: ROLL YOUR OWN

No actual "rules" here. Just do what you've committed to do. If in doubt, ask!!

## LOGISTICS 

Same basic deal as with the homeworks. 

1. From your AIST2120 folder, run `git clone [URL]` to make a local copy of this assignment. 
2. DO THE WORK (create and complete any and all needed files)
3. TEST YOUR WORK A WHOLE LOT 
4. TEST IT SOME MORE LIKE YOU MEAN IT THIS TIME 
5. When done, run `git add .` 
6. Then run `git commit â€“m "type a clever message here"` 
7. Finally run `git push` to push your changes back up to GitHub 
8. Breathe a sigh of relief
